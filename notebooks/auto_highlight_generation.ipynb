    "   - Each row displays the field name, its type, and its description.\n",
    "   - Checkboxes next to each field allow you to include or exclude it from the schema.\n",
    "     - Uncheck the box next to any field you want to exclude from the final schema.\n",
    "     - Checked fields will be included; unchecked ones will be removed.\n",
    "2. **Save Button:**\n",
    "   - Click \"Save\" to:\n",
    "     - Save your current field selections to the schema file.\n",
    "     - Refresh the list of fields to reflect your changes.\n",
    "     - Receive a confirmation popup indicating the schema was saved.\n",
    "3. **Add Manual Field:**\n",
    "   - Click \"Add Manual Field\" to open a dialog allowing you to add a new field.\n",
    "     - Enter the field name.\n",
    "     - Select the field type (string, date, time, number, integer).\n",
    "     - Choose the method (classify or generate).\n",
    "     - Enter a description.\n",
    "     - If \"classify\" is selected, you can provide enum options (comma-separated).\n",
    "   - Click \"OK\" to add the field to the schema and update the list.\n",
    "4. **Add GPT Field:**\n",
    "   - Click \"Add GPT Field\" to let GPT suggest a field based on your description.\n",
    "     - Provide a description of the field you want.\n",
    "     - The assistant will generate and add the field to the schema.\n",
    "     - (Requires an OpenAI assistant to be provided.)\n",
    "5. **Done Button:**\n",
    "   - Click \"Done\" when you have finished reviewing.\n",
    "     - The schema will be saved with your final selection.\n",
    "     - The GUI will close.\n",
    "     - A confirmation popup will appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Feel free to add, remove, or edit fields as many times as needed before clicking \"Done\".\n",
