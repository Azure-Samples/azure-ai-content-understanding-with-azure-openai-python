                "description": "Classify the segment type. There are 3 possible values: TV Program, Promos, Commercial. 1. Tv Programs are the full-length TV program and the currently running shows. Instructions for TV Programs: - When a title card appears that indicates a start of program, do not mark it as promo segment. - **Strictly follow it: If a title card appears with a different name than the program which is running previously, consider it as a start of new program, do not make any assumptions that it's a part of previous program, or just a character introduction in previous program. \n 2. Promos are short promotional clips for upcoming programs on the same or partner channels. These usually mention air times/days and do not promote brands or products. \n Instructions for Promos: -  **IMPORTANT** DO NOT classify promotion banners as Promos and DO NOT separate them as the promo segments. Only classify segments as Promos if they involve a distinct visual change or interruption that clearly separates them from the ongoing program - If a segment promotes a program but also mentions multiple brands or sponsors, classify it as a Commercial. - Identify the name of the program being promoted. - A Promo can be for the same program that is currently running, if it mentions airing time or day, and appears as a separate segment.- When a title card appears that indicates the start of program, do not mark it as promo segment. \n 3. Commercials: A paid advertisement promoting a brand, product, or service. Instructions for Commercials: - Commercials promote a product, service, or brand. - Maintain consistent naming for Brand and Product across all occurrences of the same ad. - If the same ad appears at multiple times in the video, at differnet timestamps, **treat each occurrence as a separate segment** â€” do not merge them. Just ensure that their metadata (title, brand, category, sector) remains consistent.- Make sure none of the commercials are missed, shorter commercials of 3-5 seconds should also be captured.- Jenerally In early morning shows, there are no commercials, if found validate it properly and then mark it as Commercial."
