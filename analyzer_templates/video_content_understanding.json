Just ensure that their metadata (title, brand, category, sector) remains consistent.- Make sure none of the commercials are missed, shorter commercials of 3-5 seconds should also be captured.- Jenerally In early morning shows, there are no commercials, if found validate it properly and then mark it as Commercial.",
